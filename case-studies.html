    <h2>Case Study: JP’s Story</h2>

    <p><strong>The Mission</strong><br>
    JP had spent his entire life not knowing who his biological father was. The only information he had was a possible name—vague and unconfirmed—and his AncestryDNA results. His goal wasn’t just to find a name, but to connect with his roots, understand where he came from, and, if possible, meet any siblings he might have.</p>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong><br>
    This case came with deep emotional weight and very limited starting data. The emotional sensitivity around the topic added pressure to make sure every step was respectful, accurate, and careful.</p>

    <p><strong>The Process</strong><br>
    I started by analyzing JP’s DNA matches, focusing on the closest paternal-side relatives—primarily second and third cousins. I used shared matches, surnames, and tree-building to trace common ancestors. One branch consistently aligned with both the DNA and the potential name JP had heard.</p>

    <p>From there, I researched potential sons from that branch, zeroing in on one man who matched both the name and generational timeline. I located his social media, photos, and family members—and began to build a case for this man being JP’s biological father.</p>

    <p><strong>The Breakthrough</strong><br>
    The confirmation came through shared sibling matches and direct communication. Once contact was made, the man’s children were open and welcoming. Additional DNA testing confirmed it: he had found his father’s side—and his siblings.</p>

    <p><strong>The Outcome</strong><br>
    JP is now in touch with his biological father’s family and forming relationships with siblings he never knew he had. There’s been bonding, laughter, photos shared, and a sense of belonging that had been missing for decades.</p>

    <blockquote>"DNA testing confirmed what love and intuition already told us—he is exactly where he belongs now."</blockquote>

    <h2>Case Study: Janessa’s Story</h2>

    <p><strong>The Mission</strong><br>
    JM was seeking information about her maternal grandfather’s biological family. She needed this knowledge to complete her medical history as part of the egg donation process. Her goal was to identify any living relatives who could provide background information and bring clarity to a long-standing family mystery.</p>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong><br>
    JM had no contact with her grandfather’s side of the family and very little verified information to go on. There were gaps in the family tree, no DNA results to assist the search, and no clear connections to build from.</p>

    <p><strong>The Process</strong><br>
    I began by examining the few details Janessa had about her grandfather—names, locations, and timeframes. I researched census records, marriage and death certificates, obituaries, and public directories to begin constructing the most likely branches of her family tree.</p>

    <p>As I worked, a pattern emerged within a specific sibling group tied to her grandfather’s likely identity. I traced this family through multiple generations, carefully verifying each connection with public records. Eventually, I identified a man who appeared to be her grandfather’s son—potentially JM’s uncle or her mother’s half-brother.</p>

    <p><strong>The Breakthrough</strong><br>
    The breakthrough came when I confirmed that this man shared consistent connections with several other relatives in the same family line. From there, I was able to locate living descendants of her grandfather’s siblings and identify social media profiles JM could use to reach out directly.</p>

    <p><strong>The Outcome</strong><br>
    JM now has a clear, well-researched understanding of her maternal grandfather’s biological family, including the names of potential living relatives. This has given her the opportunity to complete her medical history with confidence and opens the door to future connection, if and when she chooses.</p>
